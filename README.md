# <img src="Icon.png" width="35"/> Vue-template

With this template you can make quick wireframes or very simple applications with Vue and Vuetify as a component library.
It is also usefull as an example of how Vue.js can be integrated into an existing web projet like .Net MVC.

WARNING: if you plan to do a more complex application then use [Vue-Cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) to generate a proper maintainable template and scaffolding.
